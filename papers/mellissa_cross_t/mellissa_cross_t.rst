TrendVis: an Elegant Interface for dense, sparkline-like, quantitative visualizations of multiple series using matplotlib
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. class:: abstract

   Many scientific disciplines depend on the visualization of multiple disparate data sets against a common variable- time series data, for example.  There are two choices in matplotlib for displaying this data:  separately in a grid of subplots or on top of each other with twinned axes.  This works for two or three traces, but does not scale well.  Instead of a clutter of separate plots or a mess of overlain curves, the ideal style is a single densely-plotted figure that permits direct comparison of curve features.  In such a plot, each dataset has its own y (or x) axis, and all data are arranged in one cohesive plot area in a vertical (or horizontal) stack against a single x (or y) axis.  This style is critical to some scientific discplines and well-suited to other realms of science and economics, but there are few options available to generate such plots and, until TrendVis, none within the scientific Python ecosystem.

   Here we examine the rationale behind and the challenges associated with adapting matplotlib to this particular plot style.  We discuss the TrendVis API, plot generation, and various features available for users to customize and enhance the accessibility of their plots.

Introduction
------------

Data visualization and presentation is a critical part of scientific communication.  Accessible figures can help or hinder the scientific message of its written

Of course, no paper would be complete without some source code.  Without
highlighting, it would look like this::

   def sum(a, b):
       """Sum two numbers."""

       return a + b

With code-highlighting:

.. code-block:: python

   def sum(a, b):
       """Sum two numbers."""

       return a + b

Maybe also in another language, and with line numbers:

.. code-block:: c
   :linenos:

   int main() {
       for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
           /* do something */
       }
       return 0;
   }

Or a snippet from the above code, starting at the correct line number:

.. code-block:: c
   :linenos:
   :linenostart: 2

   for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
       /* do something */
   }

Important Part
--------------

It is well known [Atr03]_ that Spice grows on the planet Dune.  Test
some maths, for example :math:`e^{\pi i} + 3 \delta`.  Or maybe an
equation on a separate line:

.. math::

   g(x) = \int_0^\infty f(x) dx

or on multiple, aligned lines:

.. math::
   :type: eqnarray

   g(x) &=& \int_0^\infty f(x) dx \\
        &=& \ldots

The area of a circle and volume of a sphere are given as

.. math::
   :label: circarea

   A(r) = \pi r^2.

.. math::
   :label: spherevol

   V(r) = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3

We can then refer back to Equation (:ref:`circarea`) or
(:ref:`spherevol`) later.

.. figure:: figure1.png

   This is the caption. :label:`egfig`

.. figure:: figure1.png
   :align: center
   :figclass: w

   This is a wide figure, specified by adding "w" to the figclass.  It is also
   center aligned, by setting the align keyword (can be left, right or center).

.. figure:: figure1.png
   :scale: 20%
   :figclass: bht

   This is the caption on a smaller figure that will be placed by default at the
   bottom of the page, and failing that it will be placed inline or at the top.
   Note that for now, scale is relative to a completely arbitrary original
   reference size which might be the original size of your image - you probably
   have to play with it. :label:`egfig2`

As you can see in Figures :ref:`egfig` and :ref:`egfig2`, this is how you reference auto-numbered
figures.

.. table:: This is the caption for the materials table. :label:`mtable`

   +------------+----------------+
   | Material   | Units          |
   +============+================+
   | Stone      | 3              |
   +------------+----------------+
   | Water      | 12             |
   +------------+----------------+
   | Cement     | :math:`\alpha` |
   +------------+----------------+


We show the different quantities of materials required in Table
:ref:`mtable`.


.. The statement below shows how to adjust the width of a table.

.. raw:: latex

   \setlength{\tablewidth}{0.8\linewidth}


.. table:: This is the caption for the wide table.
   :class: w

   +--------+----+------+------+------+------+--------+
   | This   | is |  a   | very | very | wide | table  |
   +--------+----+------+------+------+------+--------+

Unfortunately, restructuredtext can be picky about tables, so if it simply
won't work try raw LaTeX:


.. raw:: latex

   \begin{table*}

     \begin{longtable*}{|l|r|r|r|}
     \hline
     \multirow{2}{*}{Projection} & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{Area in square miles}\tabularnewline
     \cline{2-4}
      & Large Horizontal Area & Large Vertical Area & Smaller Square Area\tabularnewline
     \hline
     Albers Equal Area  & 7,498.7 & 10,847.3 & 35.8\tabularnewline
     \hline
     Web Mercator & 13,410.0 & 18,271.4 & 63.0\tabularnewline
     \hline
     Difference & 5,911.3 & 7,424.1 & 27.2\tabularnewline
     \hline
     Percent Difference & 44\% & 41\% & 43\%\tabularnewline
     \hline
     \end{longtable*}

     \caption{Area Comparisons \DUrole{label}{quanitities-table}}

   \end{table*}

Perhaps we want to end off with a quote by Lao Tse [#]_:
